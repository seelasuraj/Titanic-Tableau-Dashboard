#  Titanic Survival Dashboard - Tableau Project

This project visualizes survival patterns of Titanic passengers using an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dataset used is a cleaned version of the Titanic dataset prepared in Python and exported to CSV format.

##  Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To understand the factors affecting passenger survival on the Titanic such as gender, class, age, and embarkation port using visual analysis in Tableau.

##  Tools Used

- **Python** â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Tableau Public** â€“ Interactive data visualization
- **GitHub** â€“ Project documentation and version control

## Key Visualizations in the Dashboard

-  Survived Rate from Embarked
-  Pclass by Sex
-  Survival Rate by Age
-  Survival Rate by Sex
-  Survival Rate by Pclass **Treemap**

---

## Key Insights

- **Females had significantly higher survival rates** compared to males
- **First-class passengers** had the highest survival rate
- Children (especially aged <10) had better survival chances
- Most survivors boarded from **Southampton**

## How It Was Built

1. Cleaned dataset using Python (missing value treatment, encoding, etc.)
2. Exported cleaned data to CSV
3. Imported into Tableau for analysis
4. Built multiple interactive charts
5. Created final dashboard layout with filters and insights
